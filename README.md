Technical writing samples with Markdown formatting.

The following writing samples comprise my professional technical writing portfolio. These samples are designed to demonstrate my ability to write internal and external technical documentation. The internal examples are intended for Domain Name System (DNS) engineers and support analysts. The external examples are intended for customers that have DNS service with the fictional company, “OurDNS”. This document does not define best practices for any type of documentation.
